# Repeat

Repetition makes perfect, in this excersise I need you to create a function will take in one pararameter which will repeat a string the number of time you specify for example:

```javascript
function stairs(num_of_stairs){
    //magic happen here
    return flight_of_stairs
}
stairs(5)
```
will output:
```sh
*
**
***
****
```

steps:
1. Create function by the name of stairs
1. return a variable with the string
