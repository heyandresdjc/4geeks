# Equalizer

Welcome to Equalizer! -sigh- no not like the movie, under his breath: "I knew I should have told him something" We are make EQ These devices strengthen (boost) or weaken (cut) the energy of specific frequency bands or "frequency ranges". Don't worry we don't need you to configure the whole thing we just though it would be cool to connect our EQ to a client our engineers have made some software that will pass you the values in an array of integers all you need to do is to print out the values in "|" per int for example:

```javascript
[5,2,3,4]
//  will output
```

```sh
|||||
||
|||
||||
```

## Instructions

1. create a function called `EQ` what will take the array.

1. Return the a an arra of string with each value turn into pipes like this:

```javascript
[
    '|||||',
    '||',
    '|||',
    '||||'
]
```

## HINTS:
- Remember exercise 13.5 and 12
- You are going to need placeholder variables
