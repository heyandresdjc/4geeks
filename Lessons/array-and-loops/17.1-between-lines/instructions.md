# Read between the line

If you are a smart you know people don't always mean what they say and when you have 100+ emails a day to read a smart filter and organizer is needed for your emails but since you use gmail you need to do it in javascript, luckily you found a plugin the provides you and array with the emails as objects all we are going to focus on is the subject object key.

## Instructions
1. Use the `for ... in ...` loop

    - if the subject has the work `meeting` you will increase the meeting counter.

    - if the subject has the work `deployment` you will increase the deploy counter.

    - if the subject has the work `budget` you will increase the budget counter.


You are going to return an object with like this one:

```javascript
stats = {
    meeting_counter: 2,
    deploy_counter: 3,
    budget_counter: 5
}
```
