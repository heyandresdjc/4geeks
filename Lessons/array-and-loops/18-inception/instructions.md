# Inception

What Mr. Cobb did not explain in the documentary is that the machine is using node 10.15 and for his misson special enhancement needed to be done to the equipment, thankfully Arthur did most of the work. These are the minds of the Inceptors and you need to process the matrixes and turn them into objects. All you have to do is to loop and apply function to each element.


## Instructions

1. Use function called `Translator()`.

1. Use the provided string translators to loop each matrix.

1. Once translated override object value.

1. Return the list of object with the overriden values.
