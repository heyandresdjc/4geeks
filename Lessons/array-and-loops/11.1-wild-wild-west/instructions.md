# Wild, Wild, West

You just learn how the `for loop` loops what If i were to tell you there is more than one way to do the same thing over and over again, a loop meant to run testing it self the `while loop`

```javascript
// starting position for the loop like the for loop I set it to 0
let i = 0
// I evaluate the loop starting to position the concondition that I want it to be for this exmaple if the number is lower then 10
while(i < 10){
    // I console log the number which I just tested
    console.log(i);
    // I increase the 'i' condition.
    i++;
}
```

This is just one many ways to loop and I don't want you to feel overwhelm with them we just want to show you there is more options out there

## Instructions

1. Create a function call `main()`

1. Create a loop which will print out every odd number from 1 to 25

1. Put all the odd numbers in an array and return it
