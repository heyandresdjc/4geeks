# Let's Play house

Not what I meant like in the TV show... I need to get better at this pop references -sigh-, fortunately you don't have to deal with him directly you just need to handle EVERY one of his lab resquest as soon as possible. you are build the new queue system. 

```javascript
// not House
{ 
    name: 'yzekgb lse9fz', 
    docID: 'kahg3y', 
    urgent: false 
}
// this is House
{
    name: 'Gregory House',
    docID: 'gh0987',
    urgent: true
}
```

## Instructions
1. Create a function called `Queue()`.
    - one paramater is going to be an array.

1. Loop the array of Objects and check the doctors ID.

1. If the ID matches Dr. House you are going to `cosole.log("WE GOT ANOTHER ONE")` and update the object the urgent key to true and return the queue with the objects updated.
